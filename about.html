        <p>I am an experienced software engineer with versatile skills.
           Much more than enjoying my job, I care to provide
           value and to solve the actual problems, my clients face.
           My goal is to make your web service as functionable and 
           reliable as possible, at the same time keeping it simple 
           and accessible.</p>
           <p>No matter, what you need - a personal website, a landing
           page for your product or a tweak in the customer service
           application for your business. Working with me you will
           be able to grow your clients base multiple times and 
           drastically improve their experience of using your services!</p>
           <p> Besides the result, the second absolutely necessary component 
           of work activity for me is timing. When I take on a project, 
           I always carefully observe, how much time it is going to take 
           me. And I let you know about my assessment before we start
           cooperating. <span id="responsibility">RESPONSIBILITY</span> is the core ideal, I pursue in my
           occupation.</p>
           <p>I am open to work in teams as well as with individual clients.
           Challenges really appeal to me, and I love to learn new skills
           and explore previously unknown sectors in my field. If you think,
           we could get together, free feel to 
           <a id="about-contact-link" href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact me</a> right now!
